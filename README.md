This application demonstrates how to implement spring boot
basic authentication/authorization using username and password.

Here we have implemented username/password based authentication.

For testing purpose I can use below user credentials.
(I have already added below user details into employee db)

{

"userName":"thamaranga",
"password":"789123"

}


{

"userName":"prakash",
"password":"787878"

}

{

"userName":"hong",
"password":"121212"

}
